# Image Colorization 

Image colorization refers to the process of adding
color to grayscale or black and white images. This is an
important task in the field of computer vision, as it allows us to
restore the vividness and vibrancy of old images and make them
more appealing to the viewer. The process of image colorization
can be challenging for several reasons. Firstly, it is a subjective
task, as different people may have different opinions about what
colors should be used for a given grayscale image. Secondly, the
process can be time-consuming and labor-intensive, especially
when performed manually. Finally, there are also technical
challenges involved, such as color consistency and preserving
the details in the image. Recently, deep learning techniques
have been applied to the task of image colorization, which
has led to significant improvements in the quality of colorized
images. However, there are still challenges to be overcome,
such as improving the realism of the generated colors and
handling complex scenes with multiple objects and diverse color
distributions.

## Introduction

Traditional methods for image colorization can be divided
into two categories: manual and semi-automated methods.
Manual methods involve a human artist manually adding
color to the gray-scale image, either using digital tools such
as a graphics tablet or by hand-painting the image. While
these methods can produce high-quality results, they are time consuming and labor-intensive, making them unsuitable for
large-scale image colorization tasks. Semi-automated methods
are designed to reduce the time and effort required for manual
colorization. These methods typically involve using a set
of pre-defined color palettes or a set of rules to automatically colorize the image. For example, some methods use a
combination of color histograms and texture information to
determine the colors for different regions in the image.
While these methods are faster than manual methods, they
are often limited by the quality of the pre-defined color
palettes or the accuracy of the rules used. In both manual
and semi-automated methods, it can be difficult to achieve
color consistency across the entire image, and preserving the
details and textures in the image can also be a challenge.
In addition, these methods may struggle to handle complex
scenes with multiple objects and diverse color distributions.
Furthermore, traditional methods can often produce results
that look unrealistic or unnatural, as they may not be able
to accurately capture the true colors and shades present in the
image. Another limitation of traditional methods is that they
do not take into account any context or information about the
scene in the image, which can lead to inaccurate colorization
